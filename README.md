# Kolum – 32-bit ARM Processor

Kolum is a fully open‑source implementation of a 32‑bit ARM processor core. Designed to serve as an educational platform as well as a foundation for further research and development, Kolum offers a clean and modular design that adheres to the ARM architecture principles.

## Overview

- **32-bit ARM Core:** Implements a subset of the ARM instruction set architecture for 32-bit operations.
- **Modular and Extensible:** Written in Verilog (or VHDL, as applicable) with a focus on clarity and modularity to facilitate understanding and extension.
- **Educational Focus:** Ideal for academic purposes, research projects, or personal exploration into ARM processor design.

## Repository Structure

- **/src**: HDL source files for the Kolum processor core.
- **/sim**: Simulation testbenches, scripts, and example programs for verifying core functionality.
- **/docs**: Documentation, design notes, and user guides.
- **/examples**: Sample programs and projects to demonstrate processor capabilities.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mmdnmz/Kolum.git
   cd Kolum
